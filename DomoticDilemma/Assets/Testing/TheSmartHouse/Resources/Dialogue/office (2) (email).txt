Dear Mary,
The convention went really badly. Because of the time I took off work for it I’m going to have to work overtime to make up for money lost. I think Aumry is mad at me, but he doesn’t say it. I’m not going to press him, I really don’t want to know.
On a happy note, it’s Quinn’s birthday soon (turning four!!!). Make sure to get a nice gift. I don’t think Quinn likes my paintings haha.
