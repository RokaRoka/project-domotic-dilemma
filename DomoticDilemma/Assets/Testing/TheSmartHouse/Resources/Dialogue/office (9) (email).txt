Dear Nova,
I’m emailing about your child’s performance in school. Quinn’s teachers have been complaining that Quinn isn’t speaking in class and doesn’t socialize well with the other children. Now I don’t want to draw conclusions, but one of Quinn’s teachers suggested to me that there may be problems at home.
I’m emailing you as a precautionary warning: the school is worried about Quinn and we wish to set up a meeting with you and your husband. Please email me back as soon as possible to arrange a meeting. 
I also understand you are going through financial troubles, as your educational payment has been delayed two months. If it’s a problem, we can work out some financial aid as well.
Best,
-Principal W}}
