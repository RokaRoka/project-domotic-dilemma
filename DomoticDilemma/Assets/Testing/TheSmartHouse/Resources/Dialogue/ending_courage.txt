Aumry: "Quinn? I’m… I’m sorry."

Aumry: "I’m sorry. I’m so sorry."

Aumry: "Quinn, if you can and I won’t mind if you don’t, please forgive me. I am incredibly sorry. The house… the house was right. The house has taken care of you where I’ve always failed. And I’m sorry you had to go through that."

Quinn: "I forgive you."
