Mary,
Quinn’s been falling behind school and I don’t know why. I think instead of talking to me (or even Aumry!) Quinn has been talking to the house. It sounds crazy, but I hear them in the middle of the night when I’m pull all-nighters to work. It’s exhausting. 
I think Quinn hates me.}}


Aumry: “I remember Nova confiding this in me, that Quinn secretly hated her. I thought it was a ridiculous notion and I told her as much… Maybe I should have listened to her.”
