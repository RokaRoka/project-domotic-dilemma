Dear Mary,
Merry Christmas! We had a fun one this year. Aumry really liked what I painted for him (image attached, you’ll like it, he didn’t get the joke in it haha). I hope you and Michelle have a wonderful end to the year!
If you don’t mind me confiding in you, I think Quinn has been talking to the house. I might be wrong, though. Is that normal with Smart Houses? I understand they’re really advanced, but this one almost seems... familial. Thoughts?

Aumry: "I still don’t remember that joke... And goodness, she sounds crazy at the end, but after what’s been going on today... that means this isn’t the first time something like this has happened?"
